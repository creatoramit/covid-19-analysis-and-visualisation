In this project, I have done the analysis of Covid-19 pandemic. Through the data analysis of cases of Covid-19 one can analyse how countries all over the world are effecting from the pandemic and compare the spread of the Covid-19 among different countries. Predictions are made with the dataset available to the individual/country/organisations, thus helping them to decide how far they are able to control the pandemic or up to how much extent they should guide preventive measures. Through this project, a step towards helping people to understand the spread and predict the cases in their country is done. In this project we also check the accuracy of covid-19 datasets by performing different algorithms.  
The aim of the project is to provide data analysis and visualisation of covid-19 (a pandemic started in December -19). Through plotting of data, various cases have been studied like most affected countries due to this pandemic. Study of data from various countries is combined to show the growth of cases and recovery graph. In this project, the predictions on various cases has been done and finally, the different algorithms are performed using weka for decision making purposes. Comparison graphs has also been plotted to analyse how much person is getting affected/recovered in certain time intervals.
